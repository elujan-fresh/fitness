							<span class="testimonials-gray">Tanja is a one-woman coalition against saggy butts and broken hearts. It is impossible to be afflicted with either after working out with Tanja.  </span>
							<span class="orange testimonials-orange">  Tanja has truly changed my body. And more than that: How I feel about my body. </span>
							<span class="testimonials-gray">Esthetically it has changed and I feel comfortable around mirrors and my own critical eye. But more than that, Tanja has taught me to trust my 
								body. There is no doubt that Tanja trains like no other. I have worked out with other trainers and done every kind of athletic exercise known to man, but nothing 
								has ever given me these kinds of results. My physical energy has sky rocketed and my attention span has expanded due to never having low blood sugar. I thought 
								I came to get the body that I had always wanted. I have received so much more and a great physique as a bonus of feeling amazing. </span>
